Hawk can be used with Drupal's REST services module amongst other things, the example here is one of the applications.

- Enable REST module (optional: get REST UI module from drupal.org for easier management).
- Enable one of the routes (/node/<nid> as an example) and enable hawk_auth as an authentication provider for the route
  and methods.
- Create a hawk credential from Profile > Hawk Credential, the ID here will be the Credential ID for Hawk.
- See https://github.com/Dragooon/php-hawk/blob/master/docs/Getting%20Started.md#client for an example to see how to
  make requests as a client
- Perform GET and POST requests at /node/<nid> using Credentials generated from the profile area.
